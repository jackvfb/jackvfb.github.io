For a look at my analytical skills check out the XXX section for highlights from past thesis work and reproducible computational research projects -- or just jump straight to my GitHub. Browse examples of my visual design capabilities, and the way in which I have used them to engage with my interests on the graphics. And if you just want to see how I write, in both a technical and a more journalistic or creative context, see examples of my compositions on the writing page.
