# Project Overview

## NBHF Odontocetes

-   Narrowband high-frequency (NBHF) clicks are produced by four species in the California Current Ecosystem
    -   ***P. dalli*** (Dall's porpoise)
    -   ***P. phocoena*** (harbor porpoise)
    -   ***K. sima*** (dwarf sperm whale)\*
    -   ***K. breviceps*** (pygmy sperm whale)\*
    
\**cryptic species*

## ADRIFT Survey

-   ADRIFT survey data are processed to detect NBHF clicks but no further steps are taken to classify to species
-   **Problem because:** surveys are extensive and could be used to estimate population abundance of cryptic *Kogia* species

## BANTER model

-   Classifies groups of clicks and/or other types of vocalizations (events) using two stages:
    -   Employs one or more call classifiers at the first stage
    -   At second stage, uses distributions of call classification probabilities, in addition to other event-level variables, to classify events

## Objective

-   Train a BANTER model to classify NBHF echolocation clicks in the California Current System
    -   Use groundtruth recordings to define classes for Dall's porpoise and harbor porpoise
    -  Use drifter recordings from Baja to define *Kogia* class

### Knowns

- A `randomForest` classification model was trained to discriminate between clusters of NBHF clicks in the California Current [@griffiths2020]
- Groundtruth recordings of Dall's porpoise had a strong affinity to one cluster

### Unknowns

- To what extent is ambiguity reduced by:
  - classifying events as opposed to individual clicks
  - using a supervised approach to training the model

# Methods

## Define Events

For recordings with known species classification, PAMguard databases are created and events are constructed using one of two methods:

### Manual

-   Click detections were reviewed referencing features such as bearing, wigner plot, and spectrum.
- Time intervals containing true clicks were designated as events with no attempt to exclude false positives.

### MTC

-   PAMguard's default harbor porpoise template was used in the MTC module to assign scores to all clicks (higher score means better match)
-   An algorithm with three parameters (threshold, min clicks per event, min seperation between events) then constructed events.
-  Analyst reviewed to identify events containing real clicks.

**Question: How do the methods compare to one another?**

## Extract click features

-   Events processed using PAMpal to extract click features with a bandpass filter 100-160 kHz
-   false positives removed by applying filters to remove
    -   duration > .02 s
    -   3dB BW > 4kHz
-   Click channel with the lesser noiseLevel chosen, if applicable.

**Question: should other steps be taken to filter clicks?**

## Train model

- `ntree=1000` for both stages of the model
- sample size left to default
